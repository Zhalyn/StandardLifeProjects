# StandardLifeProjects
During the summer of 2020 up to the end of September, I interned as a software engineer at Standard Life, a life insurance company in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Throughout the duration of summer, I worked on two web applications individually -
Journal Archive and Standard Life Home. 

# JournalArchive 
The first project I worked on was an archive for all insurance data simply called - Standard Life Journal Archive. The archive represents itself an internal website for Almaty's office to search up crucial client data by the SL's 
insurance agents.
